    "2. Identify literal vs figurative / idiomatic cues: \n",
    "- Look for physical objects, locations, bodily references, motion verbs, measurement words → favors literal senses.\n",
    "- Look for evaluative/adjectival phrases, emotions, idiomatic constructions, metaphors, or social roles → favors figurative/abstract senses.\n",
    "3. Search for collocational and syntactic signals:\n",
    "- Nearby nouns, verbs, prepositions or objects that commonly select one sense (e.g., “rail,” “sleeper,” “railway” → rail sense of track; “dribbling” + “soccer ball” → sports sense).\n",
    "- If the sentence itself strongly selects a sense (subject/object congruence), weight it heavily.\n",
    "4. Weigh ending vs precontext vs sentence:\n",
    "-Rank evidence strength: Sentence (strongest) > Precontext > Ending (if present).\n",
    "-However, a specific ending that explicitly implies a sense should override ambiguous sentence cues.\n",
    "5. Corner-case rules (explicit tie-breakers and calibration):\n",
    "- If both senses are clearly plausible (balanced evidence) → score 3 (moderate plausibility).\n",
    "- If evidence slightly favors the judged meaning but not strongly → score 4.\n",
    "- If evidence slightly disfavors it but does not contradict → score 2.\n",
    "- If judged meaning is directly contradicted by sentence or precontext → score 1.\n",
    "- If there is strong, multiple-clue support (sentence + precontext and/or explicit ending) → score 5.\n",
    "- If ending == NO ENDING and cues are mixed → bias towards 3 (avoid 4/2 unless strong single-source evidence).\n",
    "6. If story parts conflict (e.g., precontext implies one sense, ending another): Use 3 unless one part is very explicit — then choose 2 or 4.\n",
    "7. If unsure or context is weak: Default to 3 rather than guessing.\n",

    "\n",
    "*Complete each step of this process in your analysis.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Initial Context Analysis**\n",
    "* Read the **Precontext** *alone*. Which meaning(s) of \"{homonym}\" does it make you expect?\n",
    "* Read the **Ambiguous Sentence** *alone*. Is the homonym part of a common idiom (e.g., \"had guts\") or a set phrase (e.g., \"drawing water\")?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: The Ending as a Clarifier**\n",
    "* Now, read the **Ending**. How does this new information *shift* the story?\n",
    "* Does the Ending strongly *confirm* one meaning, *contradict* another, or introduce a *twist*?\n",
    "* **Crucially:** Does the Ending act as a *paraphrase* or *definition* of a figurative or idiomatic meaning (e.g., an ending of \"She was very brave\" is a direct definition for the meaning \"fortitude\")?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Holistic Coherence Check**\n",
    "* Read all three parts (Precontext, Sentence, Ending) as a *single, coherent narrative*.\n",
    "* Can all parts co-exist with the **Proposed Meaning**? Or do some parts create a conflict?\n",
    "* **Supporting Clues:** List the specific words/phrases from the *entire* story (Precontext, Sentence, or Ending) that support the **Proposed Meaning**.\n",
    "* **Conflicting Clues:** List the specific words/phrases that contradict or make the **Proposed Meaning** awkward or implausible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Final Score and Justification**\n",
    "* Based on your coherence check in Step 3, assign a score.\n",
    "* *Pay close attention to contradictions*: If a strong clue in the Ending (e.g., \"wetness on his chin\") directly conflicts with a meaning (\"propel a ball\"), the score must be low, *even if* the precontext (\"soccer ball\") supported it.\n",
    "* *Pay close attention to modifiers*: If the sentence just describes *how* an action is done (e.g., \"pick *without discernment*\"), the core action (\"select\") is still plausible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scoring Rubric:**\n",
    "* **5: Perfectly plausible.** The meaning is strongly supported by the *entire* context, and all parts of the story (Precontext, Sentence, Ending) form a consistent, logical narrative.\n",
    "* **4: Very plausible.** The meaning fits well and is consistent. There might be minor ambiguity, but no real contradictions.\n",
    "* **3: Moderately plausible.** The meaning is possible, but the context is ambiguous or contains *minor* conflicting clues that make the story a bit strange.\n",
    "* **2: Barely plausible.** The meaning *largely* conflicts with the context. You have to ignore a key piece of information (especially in the Ending) to make it fit.\n",
    "* **1: Implausible.** The meaning is directly and strongly contradicted by the context (e.g., the Ending makes it physically impossible or nonsensical).\n",
