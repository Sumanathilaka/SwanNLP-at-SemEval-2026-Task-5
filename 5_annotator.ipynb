    "* Read the **Ambiguous Sentence** *alone*. Is the homonym part of a common idiom (e.g., \"had guts\") or a set phrase (e.g., \"drawing water\")?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: The Ending as a Clarifier**\n",
    "* Now, read the **Ending**. How does this new information *shift* the story?\n",
    "* Does the Ending strongly *confirm* one meaning, *contradict* another, or introduce a *twist*?\n",
    "* **Crucially:** Does the Ending act as a *paraphrase* or *definition* of a figurative or idiomatic meaning (e.g., an ending of \"She was very brave\" is a direct definition for the meaning \"fortitude\")?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Holistic Coherence Check**\n",
    "* Read all three parts (Precontext, Sentence, Ending) as a *single, coherent narrative*.\n",
    "* Can all parts co-exist with the **Proposed Meaning**? Or do some parts create a conflict?\n",
    "* **Supporting Clues:** List the specific words/phrases from the *entire* story (Precontext, Sentence, or Ending) that support the **Proposed Meaning**.\n",
    "* **Conflicting Clues:** List the specific words/phrases that contradict or make the **Proposed Meaning** awkward or implausible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Final Score and Justification**\n",
    "* Based on your coherence check in Step 3, assign a score.\n",
    "* *Pay close attention to contradictions*: If a strong clue in the Ending directly conflicts with a meaning , the score must be low, *even if* the precontext supported it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scoring Rubric:**\n",
    "* **5: Perfectly plausible.** The meaning is strongly supported by the *entire* context, and all parts of the story (Precontext, Sentence, Ending) form a consistent, logical narrative.\n",
    "* **4: Very plausible.** The meaning fits well and is consistent. There might be minor ambiguity, but no real contradictions.\n",
    "* **3: Moderately plausible.** The meaning is possible, but the context is ambiguous or contains *minor* conflicting clues that make the story a bit strange.\n",
    "* **2: Barely plausible.** The meaning *largely* conflicts with the context. You have to ignore a key piece of information (especially in the Ending) to make it fit.\n",
    "* **1: Implausible.** The meaning is directly and strongly contradicted by the context (e.g., the Ending makes it physically impossible or nonsensical).\n",
